  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
Well first, because it is just a <em>sweet extra skill</em> to have which can help a lot in the future if I want to present ,<strong>old projects</strong> or <strong> new ideas</strong> in a clean environment. <em>People</em> have access to my ideas and can help out with their inputs in order to have different points of view and refine my projects according to the <strong>feedback</strong> that I receive.
<br>
<p>I hope that people will find my blog and start giving me feedback on my work and ideas on how to make it better day by day.</p>
<br>
<p>This would help me a lot in my development.</p>
<br>
<p>I encourage everyone that has input to share with me on this to be so kind and send me a message over the contact page and help me get better and better day by day.</p>

<h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
<div class="post-content">
  <p>When I first thought about <strong><em> learning how to </em></strong> code, I didn't have a clue where to start.
</p>
<p>So I started brwosing the web for <strong> ideas</strong> on how to begin.
</p>
<p>Just a weeks ago I came across <a href="http://getmimi.com">Mimo</a> and started to work on a real <em>blog</em> which you get to see now taking form here.</p>
